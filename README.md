# Credit-card-fraud-detection
The notebook implements a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning techniques, addressing the class imbalance problem in fraud detection. The dataset consists of anonymized credit card transactions, where fraudulent transactions make up a small percentage of the total data. To handle this imbalance, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and Borderline-SMOTE are used to generate synthetic samples of fraudulent transactions, improving model learning. The model training process involves both Random Forest and XGBoost, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, Precision-Recall AUC (PR AUC) curves are used as the primary evaluation metric instead of standard accuracy, since PR AUC better reflects a model’s ability to detect fraud while minimizing false positives. 

# Dataset 
The dataset was retrieved from an open-source website, Kaggle.com. It contains data on transactions made in 2013 by European credit card users in two days only. Thedataset consists of 31 attributes and 284,808 rows. Twenty-eight attributes are numeric variables that, due to the confidentiality and privacy of the customers, have been transformed using PCA transformation; the three remaining attributes are ”Time”, which contains the elapsed seconds between the first and other transactions of each Attribute, ”Amount” is the amount of each transaction, and the final attribute “Class” which contains binary variables where “1” is a case of fraudulent transaction, and “0” is not as case of fraudulent transaction.
